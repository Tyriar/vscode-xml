Provides XSD-based schema intellisense for XML in [Visual Studio Code](code.visualstudio.com).

The logic for extracting the schema and parsing the XML in this extension is heavily inspired by [Benito Palacios SÃ¡nchez's](https://github.com/pleonex) [atom-autocomplete-xml](https://github.com/pleonex/atom-autocomplete-xml) for Atom. The Atom package source code is released under the [MIT license](https://github.com/pleonex/atom-autocomplete-xml/blob/master/LICENSE.md).
