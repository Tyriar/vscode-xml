[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Tyriar/vscode-xml.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Tyriar/vscode-xml)

> **This extension is a work in progress and not currently functional**

Provides XSD-based schema intellisense for XML in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com).

The logic for extracting the schema and parsing the XML in this extension is heavily inspired by [Benito Palacios Sánchez's](https://github.com/pleonex) [atom-autocomplete-xml](https://github.com/pleonex/atom-autocomplete-xml) for Atom. atom-autocomplete-xml is released under the [MIT license](https://github.com/pleonex/atom-autocomplete-xml/blob/master/LICENSE.md).
